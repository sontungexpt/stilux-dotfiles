 [toggle_actions]
Toggle actions display (see --draw-actions)
A [toggle_aliasing]
Enable/Disable anti-aliasing
c [toggle_caption]
Caption entry mode. If --caption-path has been specified, then this enables caption editing. The caption at the bottom of the screen will turn yellow and can be edited. Hit return to confirm and save the caption, or escape to cancel editing. Note that you can insert an actual newline into the caption using ⟨Ctrl+return⟩.
d [toggle_filenames]
Toggle filename display (see --draw-filename)
e [toggle_exif]
(optional feature, available in this build) Toggle EXIF tag display
f [toggle_fullscreen]
Toggle fullscreen
g [toggle_fixed_geometry]
Enable/Disable automatic window resize when changing images.
h [toggle_pause]
Pause/Continue the slideshow. When it is paused, it will not automatically change slides based on --slideshow-delay.
i [toggle_info]
Toggle info display (see --info)
k [toggle_keep_vp]
Toggle zoom and viewport keeping. When enabled, feh will keep zoom and X, Y offset when switching images.
L [save_filelist]
Save the current filelist as “feh_PID_ID_filelist”. It is saved in the directory specified by --output-dir, if set, and in the current working directory otherwise.
m [toggle_menu]
Show menu. Use the arrow keys and return to select items, and ⟨escape⟩ to close the menu.
n, ⟨space⟩, ⟨Right⟩ [next_img]
Show next image. Selects the next image in thumbnail mode.
o [toggle_pointer]
Toggle pointer visibility
p, ⟨BackSpace⟩, ⟨Left⟩ [prev_img]
Show previous image. Selects the previous image in thumbnail mode.
q, ⟨Escape⟩ [quit]
Quit feh
r [reload_image]
Reload current image. Useful for webcams
s [save_image]
Save the current image as “feh_PID_ID_FILENAME”. It is saved in the directory specified by --output-dir, if set, and in the current working directory otherwise.
w [size_to_image]
Change window size to fit current image size (plus/minus zoom, if set). In scale-down and fixed-geometry mode, this also updates the window size limits.
x [close]
Close current window
z [jump_random]
Jump to a random position in the current filelist
Z [toggle_auto_zoom]
Toggle auto-zoom.
[, ] [prev_dir, next_dir]
Jump to the first image of the previous or next sequence of images sharing a directory name in the current filelist. Use --sort dirname if you would like to ensure that all images in a directory are grouped together.
<, > [orient_3, orient_1]
rotate the image 90 degrees (counter)clockwise.
 
When --edit is used, this also rotates the image in the underlying file. Rotation is lossless, but may create artifacts in some image corners when used with JPEG images. Rotating in the reverse direction will make them go away. See jpegtran(1) for more about lossless JPEG rotation. Note: feh assumes that this feature is used to normalize image orientation. For JPEG images, it will unconditionally set the EXIF orientation tag to 1 (“0,0 is top left”) after every rotation. See jpegexiforient(1) for details on how to change this flag.
_ [flip]
Vertically flip image. When --edit is used, this also flips the image in the underlying file (see above).
|[mirror]
Horizontally flip image. When --edit is used, this also flips the image in the underlying file (see above).
